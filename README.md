The answer to the question: "How do I make components with local state, like React's Object components, in Hyperapp?"

Docs are a work in progress...

## Install

### ...using npm

```
npm install hyperapp-nestable
```

And `require` (or `import`, if you're using es6 modules) in your project:

```js

const nestable = require('hyperapp-nestable')

```

### ... or include in HTML from CDN

Add this to the `<head>` of your page:

```html

<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp-nestable"></script>

```

this will export `nestable` in the global scope.

## Example

See here for a (somewhat contrived) example of how it could be used:
